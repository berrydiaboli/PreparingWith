					<header><span>Q1</span>: What is this? What's happening? Why is my computer running so slow on this site??</header>
					<p>Hey, calm down, shh, we're just mining for bitcoin, it's gonna be OK.</p>
					<p>Nah, I'm just yankin ya, this website is for the Hit* Web Series Preparing With, starring everyone’s favorite cast of weirdoes and misanthropes from the instant classic indie game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/" target="_parent">Pizza Tower</a>.</p>
					<p><small>*alright alright no need to rub it in</small></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="stickyNote">
					<header><span>Q2</span>: Oh okay, phew. But wait, what's the premise of Preparing With Peppino?</header>
					<p>It's just <i>Preparing With</i>, actually, but good question!</p>
					<p><i>Preparing With</i> follows the antics of Peppino and the other denizens of the Pizza Tower trying to run a successful cooking show after the blockbuster bomb that was NTV's <i>Pizza Tower Movie</i>. We rarely see any of the show, it’s mostly focused on the characters behind the scenes interacting.</small></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="stickyNote">
					<header><span>Q3</span>: Will there be an overarching plot, or is this series purely episodic?</header>
					<p>It's complicated. There will be a few overarching narratives in the show, maybe a two-parter here and there, but most episodes won't be connected. This show is mostly an excuse to create something for this game we love, and we're not gonna worry too much about the specifics.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="stickyNote">
					<header><span>Q4</span>: Will my <abbr title="One true pairing">OTP</abbr> be canonized?</header>
					<p>YES! Your OTP is canon, right now. But we won't tell you where. Check out every episode to find out!</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="stickyNote">
					<header><span>Q5</span>: When do the episodes come out? Or are you guys just doing it when you want to, like a bunch of sadistic hoarders?</header>
					<p>Every other Friday at noon (CST)! Provided that we don't suddenly lose all motivation and forget to write new episodes for several weeks. <small>(LOOKIN' AT NO ONE IN PARTICULAR)</small></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="stickyNote">
					<header><span>Q6</span>: Can I join? Please???</header>
					<p><s>Nope! Not unless nepotism is in your favor.</s> <a href="https://forms.gle/JUCQuVpn92RvGJBJ9" target="_blank">You can certainly try!</a></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="stickyNote">
					<header><span>Q7</span>: How can I support the show!? Let me give you money!!</header>
					<p>Alas, seeing as this is a fan project based on an existing <abbr title="Intelectual property">IP</abbr>, we cannot sell merch or start a Patreon*, I don't think. However, you CAN watch our videos and share them with your friends! Follow our artists on Twitter! Subscribe to the channel!</p>
					<blockquote>"DID SOMEBODY SAY PATREON?"</blockquote>
					<p><small>*<abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> department can confirm. Support the individual artists instead!</small></p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="stickyNote">
					<header><span>Q8</span>: What if I have suggestions for the show?</header>
					<p>Easy, <a href="mailto:cookingwithpeppino@gmail.com">send an e-mail</a>! Not too hard.</p>

				<div class="stickyNote">
					<header><span>Q9</span>: Can you feed him pasta?</header>
					<p>He really eats!</p>
