He walks away from it, smoking. Gustavo and Peppino see him, the former asking, &quot;What's with him?&quot; Peppino responds, &quot;I told him I used an old recipe in the last show that didn't have a source. Just a name: Mia Nonna.&quot; Gustavo thinks, then glares at him, asking, &quot;...Nonna Mia-- your grandmother?&quot; Peppino cheekily responds, &quot;Don't tell him.&quot;" title="Preparing With: The Noir-Se" src="img/whoissheFEB.png" /></a>
