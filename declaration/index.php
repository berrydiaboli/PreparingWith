			<h1>Declaration of Co-Dependence</h1>
			<p>The unanimous Declaration of the international Members of Preparing With. When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to construct upon the mediums and themes which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the continuation of creation.</p>
			<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all members currently in our kind are hopelessly silly, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain appreciating talents, that among these are Animation, Vocalization and the pursuit of Dumb Men.--That to exercise these gifts, Preparing With is instituted among fans, deriving their just powers from the consent of the audience, --That whenever any Form of Media becomes pandering of these ends, it is the Right of the People to point and laugh, and to inform the individuals who compose the whole that which makes them thankful, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its fanservice in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Enjoyment and Engagement.</p>
